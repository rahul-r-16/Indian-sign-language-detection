Indian Sign Language Detection

Overview:

This repository contains the code and resources for building a deep learning model to detect Indian Sign Language gestures using TensorFlow/Keras.

Features:

Data Preprocessing:

Images are preprocessed using OpenCV for resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Model Architecture: 

Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.

Training: 

The model is trained on a dataset using TensorFlow/Keras, with performance metrics monitored during training.

Evaluation:

Performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess accuracy and loss.

Deployment: 

Instructions for deploying the trained model for real-time inference.

Dataset:

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images of hand gestures corresponding to 24 different ISL signs. The images are organized into train and test sets for model training and validation.
