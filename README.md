##Indian Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning

##Overview
This repository contains code and resources for developing a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection system using deep learning and machine learning techniques. The project aims to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments by translating ISL gestures into text or speech in real-time.

##Features
Data Collection: Scripts and tools for collecting and preprocessing ISL gesture images.
Model Development: Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras for gesture recognition.
Real-time Detection: Integration of the trained models into a real-time application using OpenCV for video feed processing.
Evaluation: Metrics and tools for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
